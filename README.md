# Speech Emotion Recognition with LSTMs and MFCCs (Deep learning) 

-This repository implements a basic speech emotion recognition (SER) system using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs).

# Getting Started

-Prerequisites: This code requires Python with libraries like TensorFlow, librosa, and NumPy. Install them using pip install tensorflow librosa numpy.

-Data: Prepare your speech emotion dataset with audio samples labeled for emotions (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger).

# Honey

I'd want to assure you that I'm highly interested in learning this topic and am working hard to improve my skills in it. I have recently begun a thorough study of the principles and applications of deep learning, and I am eager to stay up with the latest advances in this field.

I understand that my deep learning adventure is still in its early stages, but I am determined to achieve a high level of knowledge and experience.

I apologize for any inconvenience caused by my lack of expertise, and I hope you pardon me.

I'd like to express my gratitude for your willingness to share your opinions with me.
